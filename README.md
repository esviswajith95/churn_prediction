# Telecom Churn Prediction

It is important for subscription services like telecom operators to identify the customers who may be on the verge of exiting their platforms.
Successfully predicting such customers can help the marketing teams at these organisations to provide offers or other inducements to retain them. In this project, Machine learning models are used to predict if a particular customer is on the verge of quitting the service. The final model is converted into a flask app and containarized with dockerfor easy deployment.
